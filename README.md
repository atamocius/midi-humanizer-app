[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1b3c7ef0-ce78-4e67-9562-e5ca11bdc3d8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/humanizer/deploys)

A hastily written app that adds randomness to MIDI note timings and velocities (AKA "humanizing"). Since I could not find one, I built one. ðŸ˜Š
